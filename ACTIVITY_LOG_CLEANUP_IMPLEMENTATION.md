# Activity Log Auto-Deletion System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview
Implemented an automated monthly activity log cleanup system with pre-deletion notifications and export functionality to save server space while ensuring users can backup their data before deletion.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### 1. **Automated Monthly Cleanup**
- **Schedule**: Logs older than 1 month are automatically deleted on the last day of every month at 11:59 PM
- **Cron Job**: `'59 23 28-31 * *'` - Runs on the last day of each month
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically determines the last day of month (handles months with 28, 29, 30, or 31 days)

### 2. **Pre-Deletion Warning System**
- **3-Day Warning**: Users receive notification on the 27th of every month (3 days before deletion)
- **Cron Job**: `'0 9 27 * *'` - Runs at 9:00 AM on the 27th
- **Notification Type**: `LOG_DELETION_REMINDER` with count and deletion date
- **Message Format**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Activity Log Cleanup: {count} logs will be deleted on {date}. Download logs before deletion if needed."

### 3. **Log Export/Download Functionality**
- **Multiple Export Options**:
  - Download all activity logs
  - Download only old logs (older than 1 month - pending deletion)
- **Format**: JSON with metadata (export date, exported by, filters, total records)
- **Access Control**: Super Admin and District Admin (role-based filtering applies)
- **Automatic Filename**: `activity-logs-[old-]YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### 4. **Post-Deletion Notification**
- **Confirmation Notification**: After successful deletion
- **Notification Type**: `SYSTEM_CLEANUP`
- **Message Format**: "System Cleanup Complete: {count} activity logs deleted (older than {date})"
- **Recipient**: All Super Admins

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Notification Page Enhancements

1. **Download Logs Button** (Top Action Bar)
   - Purple button with üì• icon
   - Visible to Super Admins only
   - Downloads all activity logs
   - Automatic filename with current date

2. **Download Old Logs Button** (Notification Actions)
   - Appears on LOG_DELETION_REMINDER notifications
   - Downloads only logs pending deletion (>1 month old)
   - Direct action from notification card

3. **Visual Indicators**
   - LOG_DELETION_REMINDER: Yellow badge with ‚ö†Ô∏è icon
   - SYSTEM_CLEANUP: Blue badge with üßπ icon
   - Clear labels: "Log Cleanup Warning" and "System Cleanup"

4. **Filter Integration**
   - New notification types added to action filter dropdown
   - Under "System" optgroup
   - Easy access to view cleanup-related notifications

## üîê Security & Permissions

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Super Admin**: Full access to all endpoints and downloads
- **District Admin**: Can view and export logs for their district only
- **Other Roles**: No access to activity log endpoints

### Data Privacy
- District Admins can only see logs from their assigned district
- Export includes user context (who exported, when, filters used)
- All endpoints protected by authentication middleware

## üìä Storage Impact

### Expected Results
Based on 15,000 submissions with monthly log deletion:

**Before Implementation:**
- Activity logs grow indefinitely
- Could reach 10-50 GB over time

**After Implementation:**
- Maximum log age: 1 month
- Estimated storage: 2-5 GB (much more manageable)
- Monthly cleanup ensures consistent space usage

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Verify cron jobs are initialized on server start
- [ ] Test manual execution of `deleteOldActivityLogs()`
- [ ] Verify notification is sent on deletion
- [ ] Test export endpoint with various filters
- [ ] Verify role-based filtering works correctly
- [ ] Check pending deletion endpoint accuracy

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Verify "Download Logs" button appears for Super Admin
- [ ] Test log download functionality
- [ ] Verify download triggers file save
- [ ] Check LOG_DELETION_REMINDER notifications display correctly
- [ ] Test "Download Old Logs" button on reminder notifications
- [ ] Verify filter dropdown includes new notification types
- [ ] Check icons and badges display correctly

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Simulate full month cycle (27th warning ‚Üí last day deletion)
- [ ] Verify notifications are created and delivered
- [ ] Test download before and after deletion
- [ ] Verify deletion count matches notification count
- [ ] Check that deleted logs are actually removed from database

## üìù User Workflow

### Monthly Cleanup Cycle

**Day 27 (3 days before deletion):**
1. System sends LOG_DELETION_REMINDER notification
2. Notification shows count of logs to be deleted
3. Super Admins see "Download Old Logs" button
4. Users can download logs before deletion

**Last Day of Month:**
1. System deletes logs older than 1 month at 11:59 PM
2. System sends SYSTEM_CLEANUP notification
3. Notification confirms deletion count and cutoff date
4. Storage space is freed up

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure `node-cron` is installed: `npm install node-cron`
2. Server timezone should be consistent for cron execution
3. MongoDB should have sufficient indexes on `createdAt` field

### Monitoring
- Check server logs for scheduler initialization
- Monitor notification delivery on 27th of each month
- Verify deletion occurs on last day of month
- Track storage usage trends

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cron jobs not running:**
- Check server timezone configuration
- Verify `initializeLogCleanupScheduler()` is called in server.js
- Check server logs for initialization message

**Download not working:**
- Verify user has Super Admin role
- Check CORS configuration for blob responses
- Ensure authentication tokens are valid

**Notifications not received:**
- Verify `notifySuperAdmins()` function is working
- Check notification model for new types
- Verify Super Admin users exist in database

## üìà Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **CSV Export**: Add CSV format option for better Excel compatibility
2. **Configurable Retention**: Allow admins to configure retention period
3. **Email Notifications**: Send email in addition to in-app notifications
4. **Archive Instead of Delete**: Move old logs to archive collection
5. **Selective Cleanup**: Allow cleanup of specific action types only
6. **Dashboard Widget**: Show cleanup status on admin dashboard
