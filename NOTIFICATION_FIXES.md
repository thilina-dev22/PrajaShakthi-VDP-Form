# Notification System - Bug Fixes & Improvements

## üêõ Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Failed Login Notifications Not Working ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Failed login attempts were not creating notifications
- Logic had circular dependency: checked for existing notifications before creating them
- Only notified AFTER 3rd attempt, but never created initial notification to count

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN)
const recentAttempts = await Notification.countDocuments({...});

if (recentAttempts >= 2) { // Only creates notification on 3rd+ attempt
    await notifySuperAdmins('FAILED_LOGIN', ...);
}
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
const recentAttempts = await Notification.countDocuments({...});
const attemptNumber = recentAttempts + 1;

// Always create notification for tracking
// Set priority based on attempt count
let priority = 'medium';
if (attemptNumber >= 5) priority = 'critical';
else if (attemptNumber >= 3) priority = 'high';

await notifySuperAdmins('FAILED_LOGIN', {
    details: { username, ipAddress, count: attemptNumber }
}, null, priority, 'security');
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Every failed login attempt is now tracked
- ‚úÖ First attempt: Medium priority
- ‚úÖ 3rd+ attempt: High priority
- ‚úÖ 5th+ attempt: Critical priority
- ‚úÖ Proper escalation based on severity

### Issue #2: District Admins Cannot See Notifications ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- NotificationBell and NotificationsPage only showed for Super Admins
- District Admins receive notifications from backend but can't view them in frontend
- Check: `if (!isSuperAdmin) return null;`

**Root Cause:**
Frontend components only checked `isSuperAdmin`, excluding District Admins who also receive notifications (for their district).

**Solution:**

**NotificationBell.jsx:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
const { isSuperAdmin } = useAuth();
if (!isSuperAdmin) return null;

// AFTER
const { isSuperAdmin, isDistrictAdmin } = useAuth();
const canViewNotifications = isSuperAdmin || isDistrictAdmin;
if (!canViewNotifications) return null;
```

**NotificationsPage.jsx:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
const { isSuperAdmin } = useAuth();
if (!isSuperAdmin) return (
    <div>Only super admins can view notifications</div>
);

// AFTER
const { isSuperAdmin, isDistrictAdmin } = useAuth();
const canViewNotifications = isSuperAdmin || isDistrictAdmin;
if (!canViewNotifications) return (
    <div>Only Super Admins and District Admins can view notifications</div>
);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ District Admins can now see notification bell
- ‚úÖ District Admins can access Notifications page
- ‚úÖ They only see notifications for their district (backend filtering)
- ‚úÖ Proper role-based access control
