## API Examples

### Change Own Password
```javascript
PUT /api/users/change-password
Headers: {
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
}
Body: {
  currentPassword: "OldPassword123",
  newPassword: "NewPassword123"
}

Response: {
  message: "Password changed successfully"
}
```

### Get Subordinate Users
```javascript
GET /api/users/subordinates
Headers: {
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
}

Response: [
  {
    _id: "userId",
    username: "district_admin_colombo",
    role: "district_admin",
    district: "Colombo",
    fullName: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    isActive: true
  },
  ...
]
```

### Reset Subordinate Password
```javascript
PUT /api/users/userId123/reset-password
Headers: {
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
}
Body: {
  newPassword: "NewPassword123"
}

Response: {
  message: "Password reset successfully",
  username: "ds_user_colombo_01"
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
2. **Current Password Verification**: Users must provide current password to change own password
3. **Hierarchical Access Control**: Strict enforcement of who can reset whose password
4. **Activity Logging**: All password changes are logged for audit purposes
5. **Notifications**: Super admins are notified of all password reset operations
6. **Cannot Self-Reset**: Admins cannot use the reset endpoint to change their own passwords
