## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Query Parameters

The frontend now sends these query parameters to `/api/notifications`:

```javascript
GET /api/notifications?limit=100&unreadOnly=false&category=security&priority=high&action=FAILED_LOGIN
```

**Parameters:**
- `limit`: Number of notifications to fetch (default: 100)
- `unreadOnly`: Boolean - only unread notifications
- `category`: Filter by category (submission, user, security, system, export, summary)
- `priority`: Filter by priority (low, medium, high, critical)
- `action`: Filter by specific action type

### State Management

```javascript
const [categoryFilter, setCategoryFilter] = useState('all');
const [priorityFilter, setPriorityFilter] = useState('all');
const [actionFilter, setActionFilter] = useState('all');
```

### Automatic Refetch

Notifications are automatically refetched when any filter changes:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    if (isSuperAdmin) {
        fetchNotifications();
    }
}, [filter, categoryFilter, priorityFilter, actionFilter, isSuperAdmin, fetchNotifications]);
```
