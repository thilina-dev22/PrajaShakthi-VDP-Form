# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Current Status

You're seeing CORS errors because the deployment configuration is incomplete. Here's what needs to be done:

---

## ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Code changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Backend CORS configuration updated in code
- ✅ Frontend code updated to use `VITE_API_URL`

---

## ⚠️ PENDING - YOU MUST DO THESE NOW

### Step 1: Check if Backend Auto-Deployed (1 minute)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your **backend project** (`praja-shakthi-vdp-form`)
3. Click on it
4. Look at the **Deployments** tab
5. Check if there's a new deployment from the recent git push

**If YES (new deployment exists):**
- ✅ Backend is already updated with CORS fix
- Proceed to Step 2

**If NO (no new deployment):**
- Click **Deployments** tab
- Click **⋮** (three dots) on the latest deployment
- Click **Redeploy**
- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete
- Then proceed to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Set Frontend Environment Variable (2 minutes) - CRITICAL

**This is why you're seeing the double slash `//` in the URL!**

1. In Vercel Dashboard, find your **frontend project** 
   - Look for: `praja-shakthi-vdp-form-5aaz` or similar
2. Click **Settings** (in the top navigation)
3. Click **Environment Variables** (in the left sidebar)
4. Click **Add New** button
5. Enter:
   ```
   Name: VITE_API_URL
   Value: https://praja-shakthi-vdp-form.vercel.app
   ```
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** No trailing slash at the end!
6. Select all 3 environments:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview  
   - ✅ Development
7. Click **Save**

---

### Step 3: Redeploy Frontend (2 minutes)

1. Stay in your frontend project
2. Click **Deployments** tab (top navigation)
3. Find the latest deployment
4. Click **⋮** (three dots) next to it
5. Click **Redeploy**
6. **UNCHECK** "Use existing build cache" (to ensure env var is picked up)
7. Click **Redeploy**
8. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

---

## 🧪 Test After Deployment (30 seconds)

1. Open: https://praja-shakthi-vdp-form-5aaz.vercel.app
2. Press **F12** (open DevTools)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Clear the console (click the 🚫 icon)
5. Refresh the page
6. Try to login

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No `localhost:5000` errors
- ✅ No double slash `//` in URLs
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ Login works!

## 🔍 Why You're Seeing Errors Now

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| CORS error | Backend not redeployed yet | Redeploy backend (or wait for auto-deploy) |
| Double slash `//` | `VITE_API_URL` not set in Vercel | Set environment variable in Vercel |
| `ERR_FAILED 308` | Redirect due to double slash | Will be fixed when env var is set |

---

## ⏱️ Total Time Required: ~5 minutes

1. Check/redeploy backend: 1-2 min
2. Set environment variable: 1 min
3. Redeploy frontend: 2-3 min
