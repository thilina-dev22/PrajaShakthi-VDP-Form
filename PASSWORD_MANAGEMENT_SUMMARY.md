### API Endpoints

```
PUT  /api/users/change-password         (All authenticated users)
GET  /api/users/subordinates            (Admins only)
PUT  /api/users/:id/reset-password      (Admins only)
```

### Testing the Feature

#### Test Own Password Change
1. Login with any account
2. Navigate to Password Management
3. Try changing password with wrong current password ‚ùå Should fail
4. Change password with correct current password ‚úÖ Should succeed
5. Logout and login with new password ‚úÖ Should work

#### Test Subordinate Password Reset (Super Admin)
1. Login as superadmin
2. Navigate to Password Management > Manage Subordinates tab
3. Select a district admin
4. Reset their password
5. Logout and login as that district admin with new password ‚úÖ Should work

#### Test Subordinate Password Reset (District Admin)
1. Login as district admin
2. Navigate to Password Management > Manage Subordinates tab
3. Select a DS user from your district
4. Reset their password
5. Logout and login as that DS user with new password ‚úÖ Should work

### Default Passwords (Created by Scripts)
- **District Admins**: `District@123`
- **DS Users**: `DSUser@123`
- **Super Admin**: Set when created

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Users should change their default passwords immediately after first login!

### Activity Logging

All password operations are logged in the activity log system:
- User who performed the action
- Timestamp
- IP address
- User agent
- Target user (for password resets)

Super admins can view these in the Activity Logs section.

### Security Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Users must verify current password before changing
2. ‚úÖ Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage
3. ‚úÖ Minimum password length enforced (6 characters)
4. ‚úÖ Admins cannot use reset endpoint on themselves
5. ‚úÖ Hierarchical permissions strictly enforced
6. ‚úÖ All operations logged for audit trail

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Password Strength Meter** - Visual indicator of password strength
2. **Password Expiry** - Force password changes every 90 days
3. **Password History** - Prevent reusing last 5 passwords
4. **Email Notifications** - Send email when password is changed
5. **2FA** - Two-factor authentication for additional security

## üéâ Ready to Deploy!

The password management system is fully functional and ready for production use. All users now have secure password management capabilities appropriate to their role.
