## Known Issues to Check

1. **Timezone Display**: Check if times are displayed in user's local timezone

3. **Special Characters**: Test with names containing special characters
4. **Concurrent Actions**: Test rapid create/update/delete actions
5. **Network Errors**: Test behavior when API is down

## Debugging Tips

### Backend Issues
```bash
# Check notification creation
db.notifications.find().sort({createdAt: -1}).limit(5)

# Check indexes
db.notifications.getIndexes()

# Count notifications by user
db.notifications.countDocuments({recipientId: ObjectId("...")})
```

### Frontend Issues
```javascript
// Check polling in browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'notifications:*')

// Check unread count
console.log('Unread count:', document.querySelector('.notification-badge')?.textContent)

// Check API calls
// Network tab -> Filter by "notifications"
```

### Common Problems

**Problem**: No notifications appearing
- Solution: Check MongoDB connection, verify Super Admin role, check console errors

**Problem**: Badge count not updating
- Solution: Check polling interval, verify API endpoint, check network tab

**Problem**: "Access Denied" for Super Admin
- Solution: Clear cookies, re-login, verify role in database

**Problem**: Notifications not marked as read
- Solution: Check API response, verify notification ID, check authentication
